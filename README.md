# Web site Aspire2 Internationl

This web site was the first assignment of internet programming in Aspire 2 International. It is a simple, dinamic and interactive web application in which is displayed the understanding of the front-end languages(HTML,CSS,JavaScript), frameworks(Boostrap) and libraries(JQuery). It is expected to show visual creativity and good design skills.
